# Taskinator 2.0
## Description
This is the second version of my Taskinator project. Taskinator is a simple kan-ban board that allows you to add and track your to-do list. Originally Taskinator used local storage to save a users tasks but Taskinator 2.0 has been updated to use a SQL database. Start adding your tasks to Taskinator 2.0!
